# About
I was contacted by an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School on LinkedIn, regarding some work I published a while back when I did my master's degree. So over the last couple of weeks, I was helping them with some coding to gather sleep and heart rate data from the fitness devices of adolescent patients with chronic pain and helped them at the Boston hospital to bring it all into a centralized DB. It was a very interesting project, we finished work on it and it felt good to be associated with something that may help sick kids. 

# Detail
This software allows to retrieve the sleep-related data from Fitbit accounts of Multiple Users (in this specific case - adolescent patients using Fitbit devices).
The program functions in a nonstandard and unobtrusive way, as it doesn't require OAuth Prompts when switching from one user to another during processing.
It retrieves OAuth access tokens silently from the each of the Fitbit devices, by leveraging Selenium ChromeDriver.
Once the authentication is obtained, the bearer information is then used to call the Fitbit API for the sleep related JSON files,
which are saved separately for each of the Fitbit users. 

# How it Works

# Requirements:
- Installed **Google Chrome vs 83**+
- **chromedriver.exe** in the program's folder (one packaged with the code is for Chrome 83+) - This is required by Selenium
- Writable subfolder 'export-patients' in the program's root
- **list-of-patients.json** - this file contains the list of patients in JSON format:
    - Specify the first name, last name of each of the users (patients)
    - Specify the web login name and password of each patient (this is the user name and password user uses to login to Fitbit)
    - The data range for which to extract the sleep patterns (start and end date)
- Python Libraries: **json5==0.8.5, requests==2.22.0 and selenium==3.141.0** web driver. If it doesn't work just run 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' in your shell

# How to Run:
- Tested on Windows 10 only (but the code should be OS agnostic)
- Run the code: `python3 process-patients.py`

# Results:
- Once the code has processed all patients entered into the list-of-patients.json file, it'll place results in JSON format to 'export-patients' subfolder Â 
- Resulting files will be named in this format:

	**FirstName-LastName__StartDate-to-EndDate.json** 
	
	e.g. Jozef-Jarosciak__2020-05-06-to-2020-05-12.json

# Issues:
- The code is currently as is, I did not have the time to code in the proper handling of exceptions and debug it.
- The risk of errors is high, especially if the credentials for users are not correctly typed into list-of-patients.json
