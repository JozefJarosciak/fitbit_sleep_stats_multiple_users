# Requirements:
- Installed **Google Chrome vs 83**+
- **chromedriver.exe** in the program's folder (one packaged with the code is for Chrome 83+)
- Writable subfolder 'export-patients' in the program's root
- **list-of-patients.json** - this file contains the list of patients in JSON format:
    - Specify the first name, last name of each of the users (patients)
    - Specify the web login name and password of each patient (this is the user name and password user uses to login to Fitbit)
    - The data range for which to extract the sleep patterns (start and end date)
- Python Libraries: **json5==0.8.5, requests==2.22.0 and selenium==3.141.0** web driver. If it doesn't work just run 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' in your shell

# How to Run:
- Tested on Windows 10 only (but the code should be OS agnostic)
- Run the code: `python3 process-patients.py`

# Results:
- Once the code has processed all patients entered into the list-of-patients.json file, it'll place results in JSON format to 'export-patients' subfolder Â 
- Resulting files will be named in this format:

	**FirstName-LastName__StartDate-to-EndDate.json** 
	
	e.g. Camila-Koike__2020-05-06-to-2020-05-12.json

# Issues:
- The code is currently as is, I did not have the time to code in the proper handling of exceptions and debug it.
- The risk of errors is high, especially if the credentials for users are not correctly typed into list-of-patients.json
